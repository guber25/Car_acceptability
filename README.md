# Car_acceptability ðŸš—
This repo was created for the project dedicated to the deployment of a machine learning model on Google Cloud and VertexAI.
This is a simple linear regression that wants to predict how acceptable is a car based on its physical characteristics. Since I was quite inexpert when I performed this deployment, I struggled a lot but have learnt a ton and had the opportunity to see and to interface for the first time with a Cloud platform.

The data I used is published here for convenience but you can find the original dataset on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajeetdas/car-acceptability-classification-dataset.
